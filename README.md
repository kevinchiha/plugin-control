# Plugin Control

Think of Sublime Text's classic Package Control or the VS Code Command Palette,
but for Omarchy Quattro plugins.

Press Ctrl+p (or click the tray icon), type a few letters to fuzzy-search, and
press Enter to open one consistent action menu for that plugin.

![Plugin Control command palette](preview.png)

Plugin Control keeps the full [@HANCORE-linux](https://github.com/HANCORE-linux)
[community marketplace](https://omarchyplugins.com/) and local plugin state in a
small cache, then filters it in process on every keypress. Startup reads only
that local cache. Press Ctrl+r when you want to refresh catalog and marketplace
metrics data from the configured sources.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/ilyaZar/plugin-control.git --enable
```

Plugin manifests cannot add global bindings. For a keyboard-only path, add this
optional binding to your repo-managed or user-owned `bindings.lua`:

```lua
o.bind(
  "CTRL + P",
  "Plugin Control",
  "omarchy-shell shell toggle io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control '{}'"
)
```

Bare Ctrl+p is quick, but it replaces the usual application shortcut while the
binding is active. Change the first string if that disrupts your setup.

## Use

Start typing to search plugin names, IDs, descriptions, authors, and tags. Enter
opens the same action menu whether the plugin came from ordinary search or an
explicit command. Ctrl+i opens the same information read-only.

The menu reflects the selected plugin's current state:

- a built-in plugin offers Cancel and Enable or Disable
- an added user plugin offers Cancel, Update, Enable or Disable, and Remove
- an available user plugin offers Cancel and Add
- an active full bar offers only Cancel; an inactive full bar can be enabled

Enable and Disable are the UI terms for the native Omarchy operation. For a
built-in bar widget, that operation may add or remove its bar placement. Plugin
Control always delegates the change to `omarchy plugin enable` or
`omarchy plugin disable`.

Use these commands to narrow the action first:

- `plug-add:` shows plugins available through `omarchy plugin add`
- `plug-remove:` shows removable local plugins
- `plug-enable:` shows disabled switchable plugins
- `plug-disable:` shows enabled switchable plugins
- `plug-update:` checks first, then shows safely updateable plugins

Four more narrow the list rather than the action:

- `plug-builtin:` shows built-in Omarchy plugins
- `plug-mine:` shows plugins you installed or cloned yourself
- `plug-disabled:` shows switched-off plugins of any origin
- `plug-type:` filters by kind — bar widget, panel, service, overlay

`plug-dis` is ambiguous on purpose and offers both `plug-disable:` (turn one
off) and `plug-disabled:` (list the off ones).

Commands are not pinned. Type `add`, `remove`, `enable`, `disable`, or `update`
to bring one forward, then press Tab or Enter to complete it. Search restarts
after the colon. Completing `plug-update:` starts its read-only check. Backspace
edits a plugin name normally; at an empty completed prefix, one press removes
the trailing space and the next clears the command.

### Chips

A chip row under the search field carries the same filters — All, Available,
Mine, Built-in, Disabled, Type — and highlights whichever one the query
currently parses to. Chips write their command into the search field rather
than holding filter state of their own, so clicking and typing drive the same
mechanism and cannot disagree. Type needs a value rather than being a boolean,
so its chip steps through the kinds and clears on the step past the last.

The footer entries are buttons too: clicking one runs the same code as its
Ctrl shortcut.

### Sort

A Sort chip sits beside the filters, also on Ctrl+o, and steps through eight
orders: best match, recently added, recent activity, most starred, most viewed,
most copied, most hearts, and A-Z. The order is state of its own rather than
another `plug-` command, because those replace each other while an order has to
combine with whichever filter and query are already active — "Mine, most
starred" is a reasonable thing to ask for.

Stars ship with the catalog. Views, copies and hearts come from the
marketplace's separate counter service, so when it has never answered the chip
steps over those three orders instead of ranking everything as zero.

Ctrl+u is the direct update-check path. It enters `plug-update:`, fetches each
added Git plugin's upstream `HEAD`, and lists only safe fast-forward updates.
It never updates a plugin by itself. Select a result, choose Update, and Plugin
Control invokes the native command:

```bash
omarchy plugin update <plugin-id> --yes
```

The `plug-update:` command and Ctrl+u shortcut were introduced in Plugin Control
0.2.0.

Already-current plugins report `Plugin already up-to-date!` when Update is
chosen. Update remains visible but dimmed for manually copied plugins, dirty
checkouts, and ahead or diverged Git histories. Rest on the dimmed action for
one second, or activate it, to see the reason. If one plugin cannot be checked,
the scan still completes and a yellow warning icon exposes that plugin's full
reason. Only failures that prevent the scan itself from completing are red.

Useful keys:

| Keys                                 | Action                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+p` or `Escape`                 | Close from the plugin list              |
| `Up`, `Down`, `Page Up`, `Page Down` | Move the selection                      |
| `Home` or `End`                      | Jump to the first or last result        |
| `Enter`                              | Complete or confirm                     |

| `Ctrl+r`                             | Refresh catalog and metrics             |
| `Ctrl+i`                             | Show read-only plugin details           |
| `Ctrl+w`                             | Open the plugin website                 |
| `Ctrl+g`                             | Open the source repository              |
| `Ctrl+s`                             | Open settings; `Escape` returns         |
| `Ctrl+o`                             | Step the sort order                     |
| `Escape` or `q` in any submenu       | Return directly to the plugin list      |

The status row keeps update and action feedback on the left and catalog
refresh feedback on the right. Running work is yellow, a successful result is
green for ten seconds, and settled timestamps are grey. If a catalog source is
temporarily unavailable, Plugin Control keeps the previous timestamp and
places a yellow warning icon beside it. Hover the icon to see which source
failed and whether the last valid cache or bundled catalog is being used. Red
is reserved for failures that prevent Plugin Control from producing usable
catalog data.

## Plugin information

Ctrl+i keeps the selected plugin strictly read-only and shows its complete,
untruncated description, author, version, source, repository, reviewed commit
when known, tags, and listing state. Marketplace-listed user plugins also show
stars, verification state, views, command copies, and anonymous hearts when
those values are cached. Verification describes marketplace checks associated
with the listed commit; it is not a security audit.

When the marketplace supplies a preview, the information view shows its card
image. Click the image to open the larger marketplace detail image. Enter or
Space returns from the full-size preview to the information view. Escape or q
returns directly from any submenu to the main plugin list. The same four keys
close the information view. Ctrl+i exposes no Add, install-in-terminal, or
other system action. Preview WebPs are downloaded only when requested and
converted through Omarchy's base ImageMagick package into a small plugin-owned
PNG cache, because the shell's Qt image loader does not include a WebP decoder.

The detail view follows the marketplace's visual language: yellow GitHub
stars, orange view and copy icons, a red-orange heart, and colored New,
Updated, Verified, and Unverified badges. New and Updated follow the same
twelve-hour window as the website, with Updated taking precedence.

Marketplace interaction totals are fetched once per explicit Ctrl+r refresh.
If that request fails, Plugin Control silently retains the last valid values
and retries on the next refresh. Missing totals remain unknown rather than
being displayed as zero.

## Start and stop

These commands enable or disable Plugin Control itself. The tray options only
control whether its icon appears after the plugin starts:

```bash
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control/bin/plugin-control start
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control/bin/plugin-control start --tray-hidden
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control/bin/plugin-control stop
```

The helper belongs to the installed plugin checkout and is not added to
`PATH`. Run it with the full path above, or from the checkout root as
`bin/plugin-control`.

`start` uses the configured tray default. `--tray-hidden` and `--tray-visible`
override it. `stop` disables the whole plugin, not only its tray icon.

## Settings

Ctrl+s opens Plugin settings, Keybindings, clean removal, and Cancel / Back.
Use `j`/`k`, arrows, mouse, or Enter; Escape or q returns directly to the plugin
list from settings or its removal confirmation.

```text
~/.config/omarchy/ilyazar.plugin-control/channels.yaml
~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua
```

```yaml
settings:
  tray-icon-hidden: false
  background_dim: false
```

Plugin Control never rewrites the user-owned Ctrl+p binding. Its other shortcuts
work only while the palette is focused. Saving a valid tray setting updates the
live bar; a CLI flag overrides it until the YAML is saved again. Set
`background_dim` to `true` only when the workspace behind Plugin Control should
be dimmed.

Settings use strict schema 2. A rejected field produces a short notification
with its value and admissible type or range. The plugin keeps the last valid
settings, or uses shipped defaults when a recoverable first-run typo has no
last-valid file. It never rewrites the invalid YAML. Version 1 is not migrated.

## Dependencies

- Omarchy Quattro and its shell
- Bash, curl, Git, and jq
- Ruby with Psych
- util-linux (`flock` and `setsid`)
- GNU coreutils (`timeout`)
- `omarchy-launch-terminal` for terminal adds

Plugin Control installs no packages and requests no elevated privileges.

## Remove

Select Plugin Control under `plug-remove:` for native removal, or open Settings
and select Cleanly remove Plugin Control and user data. The confirmation offers
three choices:

- Yes (preserve user data) uses native removal
- Yes (delete user data) removes namespaced state and the recognized Plugin
  Control keybinding before native removal
- No / abort makes no changes

The native command is:

```bash
omarchy plugin remove io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control
```

Native removal keeps:

- settings: `~/.config/omarchy/ilyazar.plugin-control/`
- cache: `~/.cache/omarchy/ilyazar.plugin-control/`
- action history: `~/.local/state/omarchy/ilyazar.plugin-control/`

Clean removal deletes the current author-namespaced paths.

## Development

```bash
tests/all.sh
shellcheck bin/plugin-control scripts/*.sh tests/*.sh
omarchy plugin validate .
```
