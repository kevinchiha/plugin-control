# Plugin Control

Think of Sublime Text's classic Package Control or the VS Code Command Palette,
but for Omarchy Quattro plugins.

Press Ctrl+P (or click the tray icon), type a few letters to fuzzy-search, and
press Enter to install or remove a plugin.

Plugin Control keeps the full [@HANCORE-linux](https://github.com/HANCORE-linux)
[community marketplace](https://omarchyplugins.com/) and local plugin state in a
small cache, then filters it in process on every keypress.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/ilyaZar/plugin-control.git --enable
```

Plugin manifests cannot add global bindings. For a keyboard-only path, add this
optional binding to your repo-managed or user-owned `bindings.lua`:

```lua
o.bind(
  "CTRL + P",
  "Plugin Control",
  "omarchy-shell shell toggle io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control '{}'"
)
```

Bare Ctrl+P is quick, but it replaces the usual application shortcut while the
binding is active. Change the first string if that disrupts your setup.

## Use

Start typing to search plugin names, IDs, descriptions, authors, and tags. Enter
opens the selected plugin's available action; Ctrl+I shows details without
changing anything.

Enter toggles anything the shell reports as present and switchable, whether it
ships with Omarchy or you installed it yourself. Removal is destructive, so it
stays behind `plug-remove:`. Bars are neither: they are replaced rather than
switched off, and the shell marks them as such.

Filter with the chips under the search field, or type the command directly —
they are the same thing, since a chip writes its command into the field:

- `plug-install:` shows available installable plugins
- `plug-remove:` shows removable local plugins
- `plug-builtin:` shows the plugins that ship with Omarchy
- `plug-mine:` shows the plugins you installed or cloned yourself
- `plug-disabled:` shows everything switched off, whatever its origin
- `plug-type: <kind>` filters by kind — bar widget, panel, service, overlay

`plug-type:` takes a value, so its chip steps through the kinds and clears on
the step past the last. Either spelling works: `bar widget` or `bar-widget`.

Commands are not pinned. Type `install`, `remove`, `plug-in`, or `plg-in` to
bring one forward, then press Tab or Enter to complete it. Search restarts after
the colon. Backspace edits a plugin name normally; at an empty completed prefix,
one press removes the trailing space and the next clears the command.

Useful keys:

| Keys                                       | Action                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+P` or `Escape`                       | Close the palette from the plugin list      |
| `Up`, `Down`, `Page Up`, `Page Down`       | Move the selection                          |
| `Home` or `End`                            | Jump to the first or last result            |
| `Enter`                                    | Complete a command or confirm an action     |
| `Tab`                                      | Complete the selected command               |
| `Ctrl+Backspace`                           | Remove the previous word                    |
| `Ctrl+U`                                   | Clear the query                             |
| `Ctrl+R`                                   | Refresh the catalog                         |
| `Ctrl+I`                                   | Show details for the selected plugin        |
| `Ctrl+W`                                   | Open the plugin website                     |
| `Ctrl+G`                                   | Open the plugin source repository           |
| `Ctrl+S`                                   | Open settings; `Escape` returns to the list |

## Install behavior

Installs run in the background by default and report their result in the palette
and a notification. The confirmation's `Run in Omarchy terminal` switch streams
native prompts instead. Both paths use the confirmed catalog snapshot.

Plugins run unsandboxed inside the shell. Marketplace validation is not a
security audit.

## Start and stop

The lifecycle helper lives inside the installed plugin:

```bash
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control/bin/plugin-control start
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control/bin/plugin-control start --tray-hidden
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control/bin/plugin-control stop
```

`start` uses the configured tray default. `--tray-hidden` and `--tray-visible`
override it; `stop` disables the plugin.

## Settings

Ctrl+S opens Plugin settings, Keybindings, and Cancel / Back. Use `j`/`k`,
arrows, mouse, or Enter; Escape returns to the plugin list.

```text
~/.config/omarchy/plugin-control/channels.yaml
~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua
```

```yaml
settings:
  tray-icon-hidden: false
```

Plugin Control never rewrites the user-owned Ctrl+P binding. Its other shortcuts
work only while the palette is focused. Saving a valid tray setting updates the
live bar; a CLI flag overrides it until the YAML is saved again.

Settings use strict schema 2. Invalid edits keep the last valid schema-2 file;
version 1 is not migrated.

## Dependencies

- Omarchy Quattro and its shell
- Bash, curl, Git, and jq
- Ruby with Psych
- util-linux (`flock` and `setsid`)
- GNU coreutils (`timeout`)
- `omarchy-launch-terminal` for terminal installs

Plugin Control installs no packages and requests no elevated privileges.

## Remove

Select Plugin Control under `plug-remove:` or right-click its bar icon and
choose Remove Plugin Control. Both paths open the same No/Yes warning. The
native command is:

```bash
omarchy plugin remove io.github.ilyazar.plugin-control
```

Remove the optional Ctrl+P binding separately. Native removal keeps:

- settings: `~/.config/omarchy/plugin-control/`
- cache: `~/.cache/omarchy/plugin-control/`
- action history: `~/.local/state/omarchy/plugin-control/`

## Development

```bash
tests/all.sh
shellcheck bin/plugin-control scripts/*.sh tests/*.sh
omarchy plugin validate .
```
